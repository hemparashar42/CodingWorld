Problem Description
There are A people standing in a circle. Person 1 kills their immediate clockwise neighbour and pass the knife to the next person standing in circle. This process continues till there is only 1 person remaining. Find the last person standing in the circle.


Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 105


Input Format
First argument A is an integer.


Output Format
Return an integer.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = 4
Input 2:
A = 5


Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:
3


Example Explanation
For Input 1:
Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then the person at position 4 is killed,
then the person at position 3 is killed. So the person at position 1 survives. 
For Input 2:
 
Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then the person at position 4 is killed, 
then the person at position 1 is killed. Finally, the person at position 5 is killed. 
So the person at position 3 survives. 


Solution Approach:
Reduce the problem to smaller problem.
Observations:
If N is a power of 2, beginner is the winner
Else, count the number of killings to make no of people = power of N, 
To find the winner, 1+k*2 is the beginner after k killings so that N-k is a power of 2.

Method used to find if a number N is a power of 2 is bitwise AND (&) N&(N-1) ==0, then N is a power of 2.

public int solve(int A) {
        int k = 0;  // number of killings to be done
        while(((A-k)&(A-k-1))!=0)
        {
            k++;
        }
        return 1+k*2;
    }
